# OTP Authentication API

This API performs actions related to passkeys.

## Send Code

Creates and assigns a new OTP code for the user and sends out an SMS or email.

<Route route="POST /1/auth/otp/send-code" />

## Verify Code

Verifies the sent code and authenticates the user. Note that this route is also
used for verifying codes in an MFA flow. In this flow the password must also be
recently verified and an error will be thrown if not.

This route also will set the email or phone verified status.

<Route route="POST /1/auth/otp/login" />

## Register

Registers a new user without a password. Note that this route is only used for
OTP login and not MFA.

<Route route="POST /1/auth/otp/register" />
