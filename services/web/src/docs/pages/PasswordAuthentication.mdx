# Password Authentication API

This API performs signup, login, and password self-administration such as
resetting of password.

## Register

Creates a new user object in the system. This can be initiated without any
authentication.

<Route route="POST /1/auth/password/register" />

_Note: If you want to update other attributes on a User, please see the
`PATCH /1/users/me` API call_

## Login

This exchanges a user's credentials (email and password) for a JWT token. This
token can be used for authentication on all subsequent API calls (See Getting
Started). Unless the user has MFA enabled.

<Route route="POST /1/auth/password/login" />

## Request Password

This call can be used for the user to reset their password. A temporary token
and link will be mailed to the user's email address if found in the system.

<Route route="POST /1/auth/password/request" />

## Set Password

Sets a new password for the user.

<Route route="POST /1/auth/password/update" />
