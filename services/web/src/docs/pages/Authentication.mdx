# Authentication

The authentication APIs provide different way to handle user authentication. The
following subroutes are provided for each authentication flow:

- [Password](/docs/password)
- [Passkey](/docs/passkey)
- [Google](/docs/google)
- [Apple](/docs/apple)
- [TOTP](/docs/totp)
- [OTP](/docs/otp)

Additional routes are provided for general authentication needs:

## Logout

This deauthenticates all tokens for the given user

<Route route="POST /1/auth/logout" />

## MFA Method

Updates the MFA method for the user. Note that the methods `sms` or `email` are
handled by [OTP](/docs/otp) routes and `totp` is handled by [TOTP](/docs/totp).

<Route route="PATCH /1/auth/mfa-method" />
